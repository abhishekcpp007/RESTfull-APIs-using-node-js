## Introduction

This project includes an Express.js server with middleware and routes to demonstrate the basic structure of an API application.

## Setting Up

1. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Ensure you have a Node.js environment set up.

## Middleware

The code contains a custom middleware function `myMiddleWare` that logs a message when a request is received. It then passes control to the next step using `next()`.

## Routes

The code uses the `idea.routes.js` file to define routes and their associated functions. The routes can be configured in this file to handle various API endpoints.

## Starting the Server

To start the server, execute the command `node filename.js`, where `filename.js` is the name of the file containing the provided code. In this case, the filename is not mentioned, but you can replace it with the actual filename.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or want to enhance the provided code, feel free to create a pull request.
